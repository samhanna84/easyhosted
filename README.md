## Everything is already configured to contain the data within it's own folder. That way it is easy to configure the service or for making backups.


### Please be sure install docker first.

### Navigate to the folder for the service you want to install.
<table><tr><td>cd foldername/</td></tr></table>

###  Then type command below to install it.
<table><tr><td>sudo docker-compose up -d</td></tr></table>
